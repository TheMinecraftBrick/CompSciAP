The first step was to create the array. because i had previous knowledge in arrays work with this should be easy. 
The next step was to compute the primes. First i set every number in the array (using a for loop) to true
Next i went and checked every number and if it was true check it for real using the isPrime method described
later. 
In the isPrime method i use the division method, checkign each number to see if it is prime, if the remaineder is 0, 
it is not prime, any number less than or equal to one is also not prime. all other numbers should be prime then.
back to the top, after i have defined which numbers are an arent prime, i mutliply by itself and add 1 to get every
 possible prime number in that range.
 lastly, for displaying my primes, i just simply output it using a sysout statement. additionally to drop down a
 line every 1 numbers, i made a drop integer which adds a line break anytime the remainder of 15 is 0. I had some 
 trouble figuring this out as the 15 number was a weird number to use. I also had to put format the numbers using 
 the decimal format method. all in all, it was a rather simple lab, with a few hiccups here and there.
